# DB Schema Redesign
Moving forward with the database design. We are going to rewrite the way we
interact with the db, the models, how we keep track of the changes.

## Implicaton of the changes
We are starting from scratch, new design, new folder structure. We will use the
knowledge acquired from previous work.
For sure when this new structure goes into production a one time migration
should be applied to migrate all existing data into the new structure.
Also all other apps that are currently querying directly the database will have
to change and start using the api.

## SQLAlchemy + Alembic
We will still use SQLAlchemy to interact with the db, each class will be related
to a single table for now. We will try to keep it as simple as possible to avoid
confusions and avoiding extra complexity.

Alembic give us the possibility to create migrations manually or to discover
changes directly from models definition using Base.metadata information.
